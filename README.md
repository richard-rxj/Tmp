# Technical test

This is a technical test only

## What I did

* ###  I implemented all /tasks and /todo endpoints according to the given spec
* ###  I added in-line documentation if the related code is not self-explained
* ###  I implemented some unit tests (note: more unit tests can be added) 
  * one sample unit test for controller
  * one sample unit test for service
  
## What can be further improved
* ###  To add more unit tests
* ###  To add integration tests
* ###  To have separated data layer
